I am a senior electrical engineering student who has great affinity with Business Management, Data Analysis and IoT, with professional experience on those fields, developing skills of team management, leadership and planning. Looking forward to pivot from a strictly technical area to management/entrepreneurism/business/marketing fields, I hope to work in areas related to data science, since I believe data analysis is intimately related to how commerce and industry will behave in a near future, already being a protagonist in various successful companies. This is the reason I want to work at Amazon: to bring to the company my passion and focus, while learning and developing my professional and interpersonal abilities.
